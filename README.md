- "Supercritical combustion".

Personal notes ("Mes cahiers"):
- Differential geometry
- General mechanics
- Incompressible turbulence (Based on Frisch book.) Part2 to come.
- Compressible LES (Based on Garnier / Sagaut book)

- Thermodynamics (To be rearranged. Based on Callen and Kestin books)
- EDO-EDP-Vector calculus
- Basic Algebra. Work in progress.
- Barotropic flows
